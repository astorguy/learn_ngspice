# Learn Ngspice
Learning Ngspice is a difficult endeavor, with bewildering commands and syntax. You can master Ngspice with the help of Python. We have created full-functioning notebooks that can be used with Google Colabs or Jupyter.
## Ngspice
[Ngspice](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/) is an open-source circuit simulator for exploring and validating electronic designs. Experiment with design alternatives, optimize operation, and understand how operation changes under real-world conditions.
## Google Colabs
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
is a cloud-based notebook environment for writing, running, and sharing code. Prototype ideas quickly, execute computations without local setup, and collaborate through live notebooks that combine code, results, and documentation.
## py4spice
Interaction with Ngspice from the Colab notebook is faciliated by the [py4spice](https://pypi.org/project/py4spice/) Python package available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).
## Usage
A Google account is necessary to run Google Colabs. The easiest way to run these Colabs is to select the ***Open in Colab*** button at the top of the notebook. The notebooks are in the the [notebooks](https://github.com/astorguy/ngspice-colabs/tree/main/notebooks) subdirectory. It's best to start with the [divider.ipynb](https://github.com/astorguy/ngspice-colabs/blob/main/notebooks/divider.ipynb) notebook, since is has fuller explanations of operation for those unfamiliar with Ngspice and py4spice.

| Example | Description | Features |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| [divider.ipynb](https://github.com/astorguy/ngspice-colabs/blob/main/notebooks/divider.ipynb) | Simple resistor divider| Ngspice introduction, py4spice introduction, condensed output |

| [rlc_widgets.ipynb](https://github.com/astorguy/ngspice-colabs/blob/main/notebooks/rlc_widgets.ipynb)| Parallel RLC | plotting, Jupyter widgets, interactive, simulation in loop |
