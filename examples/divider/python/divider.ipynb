    "### Simple voltage divider\n",
    "We are using a simple resistor voltage divider circuit (`dut.cir`) to introduce Ngspice and the py4spice Python package. The circuit is a DC voltage supply (`V1`) connected across two resistors (`R1 R2`) in series. The node (`out`) between the resistor is the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ngspice can be run in a number of different ways. The method used in this example is ***opinionated***. When using py4spice in a Python script/Jupyter Notebook, Ngspice is run in batch mode, reading a single top-level netlist. The netlist contains everything Ngspice needs for simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using py4spice the script will typically entail six steps:\n",
    "1. Set up\n",
